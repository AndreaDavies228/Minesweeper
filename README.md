# Minesweeper

This is a game of Minesweeper created using Python 3, to be played in the terminal using the keyboard.

## Background

This terminal game was created as my python programming project, as part of my Codecademy computer science course, and is my first coding project.

## How to Use

Make sure that you have Python 3 installed, including the "random" and "time" modules.

1. Download the repository from Github

2. To start the game run the Minesweper.py file in Python from the main directory

```bash
$ python -m Minesweeper
```

## How to Play

Use the wasd keys to move, f to raise or lower flags, and e to examine for mines.
Examining a tile reveals how many mines are in neighbouring tiles.

To win the game you should correctly place flags on all mines, without any flags on empty tiles.
If you examine a tile with a mine, you lose the game.

There are three sizes of board to choose from, and the number of mines is randomised based on the size of the board.
