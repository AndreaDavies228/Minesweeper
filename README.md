# Minesweeper

This is a game of minesweeper to be played in the terminal using the keyboard.
Use the wasd keys to move, f to raise or lower flags, and e to examine for mines.
There are three sizes of board to choose from, and the number of mines is randomised based on the size of the board.

## Background

This terminal game was created as my python programming project, as part of my Codecademy computer science course.
